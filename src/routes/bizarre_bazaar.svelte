        <h3>A game designed by Adam Winchell and Pierre Delcourt</h3>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Welcome to the Bizarre Bazaar, where you turn ordinary into extraordinary!</p>
        <p>Bizarre Bazaar offers a humorous and memorable way to teach players new vocabulary while immersing them in a fusion of reality and myth.</p>
        <p>4-7+ Players, ages 12+</p>
        <p>30-60 minutes</p>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>The rules can be downloaded <a target="_self" href="games/Bizarre_Bazaar_Rules.pdf">here</a>. A quick overview of the rules can be found below.</p>
        <p>Each round, the Buyer draws a Role card and becomes a mundane human or a fantastic creature. All other players use Quality (adjective or gerund) and Item 
            (noun) cards to invent Quality Items. These combinations are placed in bags that are shuffled and distributed to new, 
            unsuspecting players. To the best of their abilities, players then attempt to sell the bizarre contents of their bags, and the Buyer chooses which 
            one of these Quality Items wins the round. The players who created and pitched the chosen Quality Item each receive one of the winning cards as a reward.
             The Buyer switches roles with the player to their left and play continues until a predetermined number of rounds has been completed. 
             Prepare for mutually assured amusement!</p>
